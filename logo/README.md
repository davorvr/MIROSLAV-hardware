# MIROSLAV logo

Drawn by: **Petra Šoštarić Mužić**

The adjusted version makes parts of the background transparent and shortens the cables to fit into a hexagon. The hexagonal sticker used as the MIROSLAV logo was made using the [`hexSticker`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hexSticker/index.html) package.
